lrzip-next features file.

Last updated 24-October 2023

Many new changes, not in the lrzip.

COMPRESSION/DECOMPRESSION
* latest LZMA (23.01) and ZPAQ (7.15) libraries (**ABI Compatible** with earlier versions. No need to re-compress files).
* filters for x86, ARM, ARMT, ARM64 (new in 23.01), PPC, SPARC, IA64 processors, and delta.
* ASM LZMA DeCompressor (up to 40% faster. x86_64 only).
* ASM LZMA Match Finder (x86_64 only).
* ability to set rzip pre-compression level independently of compression level.
* variable compressibility threshold testing.
* ability to set specific LZMA Dictionary Size.
* when setting dictsize, zpaqbs, bzip3bs, do not change size. Reduce threads as required or fail!
* improved memory management favoring large chunk and dictionary sizes over maxmizing number of threads.
* improved ZPAQ processing by analyzing data prior to sending to compressor.
* ZPAQ 7.15 library (Levels 1-5, random and text modes only. Binary mode (e8e9) covered by lzma-next filters).
* ZPAQ compression settings stored in magic header. Will show in INFO output.
* ZPAQ Compression Block Size can be independently set from 2MB to 2GB.
* many bug fixes including validating a file prior to decompression (prevents corrupt file decompression before it starts!).
* lz4 Threshold testing (replaces lzo).
* Users can add Comments with -C|--comment option
* Magic header will store compression level used.
* Magic header will store compression method used.
* BZIP3 Support - Kamila Szewczyk
* ZSTD Support
* Ability to inhibit use of multi-threading by compression backends --nobemt (No BackEnd Multi Threading).
* lzo backend: use lzo1x_999_compress() function for level 9 to enhance compression.

HASHING/ENCRYPTION
* Substitute libgcrypt functions for separate sources for **md5** and **sha512** hash functions, and **aes 128 bit** encryption.\
(This will allow for future bug fixes and possibly using different encryption methods through a standard library.)
* SCRYPT (Bitcoin style) Key Derivation.
* 13 Hash options (see CURRENT_HASHES)
* 2 Encryption options (see CURRENT_ENCMETHODS)
* Configurable with `lrzip.conf` file

BUILD
* use of git describe to present current version without changing configure.ac.
* REMOVE 32-BIT Architecture support
* REMOVE support for `lrzip` versions < 0.6
* Update autofoo to remove obsolete macros
* All filenames and symlinks and manpages now distinct from `lrzip`
* Remove -r Recursive option
* Remove gzip option compatibility and symlink `lrzn`. `lrzip-next` options prevail.
* add --enable-debug switch to configure.

GENERAL/OUTPUT
* more helpful usage messages.
* improved info reporting, column alignment, improved formatting, thousands separator.
* File info `lrzip-next -i` will now fetch info from encrypted files with password.
* `lrzip-next -i` will not print percent info when file size is not known.
* `lrzip-next -i` will format data with thousands separators.
* Configurable LOCALE settings via lrzip.conf
* BSD Support.
* /tmp is now default temporary dir. Set TMP to override.
* -Q | --very-quiet option to suppress ALL output.
